# OASIS INFOBYTE - PYTHON DEVELOPER INTERNSHIP PROJECTS

This repository contains multiple Python projects. Each project addresses different tasks and demonstrates various programming concepts.

## Task 1: BMI Calculator

### Description:
This project provides a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. It allows users to input their weight and height and then calculates their BMI. It also classifies the calculated BMI into different categories such as "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," or "Obese."

### Usage:
To use the BMI calculator:
1. Run the `task1.py` file.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms when prompted.
3. Enter your height in centimeters when prompted.
4. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result along with your BMI category.

## Task 2: Password Generator

### Description:
This project generates random passwords based on user preferences. Users can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols in the generated password.

### Usage:
To use the password generator:
1. Run the `task2.py` file.
2. Enter the desired length for the password.
3. Choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols by entering 'y' for yes or 'n' for no when prompted.
4. The program will generate a random password based on the provided preferences and display it.

## Task 3: Chat Server and Client

### Description:
This project implements a simple chat server and client using sockets and threading in Python. The server allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously and communicate with each other. 

### Usage:
1. Start the server by running the `task3_server.py` file.
2. Start the client by running the `task3_client.py` file.
3. Follow the instructions to send and receive messages between clients.
